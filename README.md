### **World Layoffs & Jobs: SQL Analysis**

#### **Project Overview**
This project explores real-world layoffs and job trends using SQL queries to clean, analyze, and extract insights from layoff data. It simulates a **data analyst's role** in handling **real-time datasets**, performing **data cleaning**, and executing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  

#### **Motivation**
With increasing job market fluctuations, layoffs have become a critical area for analysis. This project aims to:
- Enhance SQL proficiency by working with **real-world data.**  
- Apply **data cleaning** techniques to ensure accuracy.  
- Explore job market trends using **analytical SQL queries.**  
- Utilize **CTEs, Window Functions, Joins, and Aggregations** for deeper insights.  

#### **Research Questions**
1. What are the **layoff trends** across different industries?  
2. Which companies had the **highest number of layoffs**?  
3. How do **layoffs vary by country** and company size?  
4. What **patterns emerge over time** in the job market?  
5. Which industries are **most affected** by economic downturns?  

#### **Data Sources**
- **Dataset**: `layoffs.csv` (Real-world layoffs dataset)
- **SQL Scripts**:
  - **Data Cleaning** (`Data_cleaning.sql`): Preprocessing and standardizing raw data.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (`Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql`): Analyzing trends and extracting insights.  

#### **SQL Techniques Used**
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Organizing queries for readability.  
- **Window Functions**: Ranking and analyzing trends.  
- **Aggregations & Joins**: Combining multiple tables for deeper insights.  
- **Case Statements**: Creating categorical insights.  
- **Subqueries**: Enhancing query efficiency.  

#### **Repository Structure**
```
ðŸ“‚ World_Layoffs_Jobs
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ layoffs.csv               # Raw dataset  
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ Data_cleaning.sql         # Data cleaning queries  
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql  # EDA queries  
 â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“„ README.md                 # Project documentation  
```

#### **Usage**
1. Load `layoffs.csv` into your SQL database.  
2. Run `Data_cleaning.sql` to prepare the dataset.  
3. Execute `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.sql` to derive insights.
